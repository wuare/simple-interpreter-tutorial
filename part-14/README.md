#### goal
- We’re going to learn about scopes, why they are useful, and how to implement them in code with symbol tables.
- We’re going to learn about nested scopes and how chained scoped symbol tables are used to implement nested scopes.
- We’re going to learn how to parse procedure declarations with formal parameters and how to represent a procedure symbol in code.
- We’re going to learn how to extend our semantic analyzer to do semantic checks in the presence of nested scopes.
- We’re going to learn more about name resolution and how the semantic analyzer resolves names to their declarations when a program has nested scopes.
- We’re going to learn how to build a scope tree.
- We’re also going to learn how to write our very own source-to-source compiler today! We will see later in the article how relevant it is to our discussion of scopes.
